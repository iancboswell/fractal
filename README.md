_Fractals in JavaScript_

This repository contains libraries to generate pseudorandom fractal terrain using Perlin and Diamond-Square algorithms, as well as demos illustrating their use. NB: the libraries are presented as CommonJS modules. If you'd like to use them (and please feel free to! See LICENSE) in the browser, you'll want to also use a library that loads such modules, such as [http://browserify.org/](Browserify).
